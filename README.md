Business Problem:

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium sized machines. We have been providing high quality air transportation services to out clients for several years and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable and convenient journey for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, increased tax rates, raising fuel prices, tight labour market, increased interest rates. As a result, profitability id under pressure and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help to increase average profit earned per seat.

Main Challenges:

1.	Stricter Environmental Regulations: The demand on the airlines industry to decrease its carbon footprint is growing, which has resulted in more stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
2.	Higher Flight Taxes: To solve environmental issues and raise money, governments all around the world are taxiing aircraft more heavily, which raises the cost of flying and decreases demand.
3.	Tight Labor Market: Lack of trained people in the aviation sector has increased labour costs and turnover rates.

Objectives:

1.	Increase Occupancy Rate: By increasing the occupancy rate, we can boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of challenges we are facing.
2.	Improve Pricing Strategy: We need to develop a pricing strategy that takes into account the changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.
3.	Enhance Customer Experience: We need to focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival, to differentiate ourselves in a highly competitive industry and increase customer loyalty.

The end goal of this task is to identify opportunities to increase occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to increase in profitability of airline.
